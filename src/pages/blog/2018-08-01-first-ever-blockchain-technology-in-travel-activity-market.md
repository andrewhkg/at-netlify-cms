Over recent years, blockchain technology has generated significant excitement within many industries and fields. This is largely because it has the potential to dramatically change the way in which information or data is stored and used, enhancing transparency and security, while also improving transactions. Here, we take a more detailed look at the various ways in which blockchain is being used, or is likely to be used, within the travel industry.

Understanding Blockchain Technology: What Is It?

Although blockchain technology can sound confusing at first, it is actually pretty simple to get to grips with. Ultimately, it is a list of public records, also known as a public ledger, where transactions between parties are listed or stored. Each record, known as a ‘block’ within blockchain terminology, is secured using cryptography.

One of the most crucial aspects of blockchain technology is that data is decentralised, with information shared across a peer-to-peer network. Each block contains transaction information and a time stamp. Blocks are also permanent and cannot be altered without consensus from the entire network and without altering all subsequent blocks.

The decentralised, permanent, time stamped and unalterable nature of the data recorded in the blockchain means that data is more secure, traceable and transparent. After all, there is no central point of vulnerability or failure, and the data itself is resistant to modification and unwanted tampering.
